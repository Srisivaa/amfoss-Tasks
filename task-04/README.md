4. Gopal and his PagePal
Meet Gopal, a book enthusiast who has a great passion for reading books. He ran into trouble trying to locate his favourite books, which led to him coming up with the idea of creating a chatbot that would assist him by recommending a list of books with the necessary details. Unfortunately, Gopal's lack of programming skills proved a significant obstacle in making his "PagePal" a reality.
As a programmer, help Gopal in uniting him with his PagePal. Create a book recommendation telegram bot that displays a list of books with details like Book title, author, description, year published (originally), language, and preview (if available) when the user types in the genre of the book they want to read. Feel free to customise your PagePal with more features.
