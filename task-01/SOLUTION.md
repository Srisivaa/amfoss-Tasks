1. Type Maestro
Typing is the bread and butter of programming, despite that, many programmers struggle with proper typing techniques. This task aims to introduce you to the system of touch typing, not only will it make you a blazingly fast keyboard wiz, it will also save you from chronic neck pain years down the line!
Create an account on typing.com and follow the guided lessons. Aim to put in at least 5-10 mins every single day, it takes consistency to build muscle memory, not large chunks of dedicated time. You may be slow at the start, but after a few weeks, you’ll be typing faster than most of your peers.
You can consider yourself as having passed this task if you’re able to type at  least 60 WPM (Words per minute) on monkeytype 30 seconds with at least 95% accuracy. Go ahead and post your high score in #general on Discord for some extra brownie points :) 
Note that you must use touch typing to achieve this WPM.
