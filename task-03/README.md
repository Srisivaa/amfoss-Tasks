In this task, you are given 4 sub-tasks. You need to solve the below given sub-tasks in all of the following languages to complete this task successfully: Python, Ruby, Elixir, Javascript, Java, Go, C, C++, Rust, and Haskell.

You have the following sub-tasks to implement:
1. Sub-Task 1: Write a "Hello, World!" program.
2. Sub-Task 2: Write a program that reads a string from a file named input.txt and writes that string to another file named output.txt.
3. Sub-Task 3: Write a program that takes a number n from user and generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (*) and prints it to the console.
4. Sub-Task 4: Write a program that reads a number n from a file named input.txt and generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (*) in another file named output.txt.


For example, if n is 5, the pattern should be:
  *
***
*****
***
 *
	Once you conquer the task, organise your solutions into folders for each programming language inside the task-03 folder of your repository. Each language folder should have separate files for Sub-Task 1, Sub-Task 2, Sub-Task 3 and Sub-Task 4.



# My Approach ->
I initially struggled with this task, spending excessive time on language learning. However, I eventually realized the inefficiency of this approach. Instead, I focused on understanding the problem logic and quickly grasped language syntax from resources like W3Schools. This strategy saved time and led to efficient task completion.
