2. Terminal Chaos
In the unforgiving environments of the Warhammer universe, unending war blurs the lines between good and evil. You will assume the role of an Astarte, a mighty warrior of the Imperium of Man, forged through rigorous terminal training and gene-git augmentation. Amidst the relentless battle against the Orbs, an unexpected twist transports you to the desolate planet Arrakis-dex, where your journey begins.
Explore the Linux command line and use it to your advantage. Overcome the obstacles and solve the riddles to get secret codes which will lead you to the completion of this task. Survive and break the chains that seal you, Astarte. Purge all heretics. Glory to the EMPEROR!!!
This task aims to familiarise you with basic terminal and git commands in a fun and interactive way. You can refer to the following resource for a primer on terminal commands. We expect you to find the rest yourself via googling, good luck :)
