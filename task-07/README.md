7. Pirate's Dilemma
Captain Jack Sparrow, a brave soul on the lookout for treasures, has recently laid his hands on the latest cinematic marvel from the vast expanse of archive.org. A true gem it be, a movie that promises laughter, tears, and the thrill of the high seas. Yet, in a twist of fate, our dear captain finds himself adrift without the companion that every movie marauder longs for – subtitles!
The quest is clear – to scrape the subtitle shores and uncover the hidden text that shall accompany their voyage.
Create a CLI app using Python that accepts an mp4 file and returns a list of subtitles for it, allowing the user to choose and download their preferred option.
