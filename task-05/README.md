Greetings, Shoppers! Welcome to the TerminalTrolly Challenge—a test of your problem-solving skills in the world of web.


Imagine you're part of a team responsible for managing a trendy online hypermarket. Unfortunately, our e-commerce platform has encountered unexpected technical issues, leaving customers unable to make purchases through the website.


To keep our loyal customers happy and the business running smoothly, we've devised a special challenge for you. Using a terminal-based interface—a digital lifeline to our shop's backend—you'll step into the shoes of our tech-savvy troubleshooters.


Your mission is clear: navigate through the virtual maze of glitchy code and faulty scripts to successfully purchase products from our hypermarket.
