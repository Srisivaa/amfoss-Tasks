# Ubuntu Installation 

Linux is widely recognized among developers for its robust security measures, stable performance, and flexibility. Its open-source nature allows for extensive customization and adaptation to various development needs.
We need you to install Linux. Don’t forget to backup important data before adjusting disk partitions. We could dual boot Linux along with Windows.

1. Ensure the following:
    A computer preinstalled with Windows
    A partitioned hard drive
    A BIOS in UEFI mode (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
    An empty USB drive of at least 16Gb for creating a bootable disk
    An internet connection to download Ubuntu ISO image (the Linux distro) and Rufus.
2. First download the latest Ubuntu distribution iso file from the nearest Ubuntu mirror.
Eg: https://iws44.iiita.ac.in/iso/ubuntu/ubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso

3. Download Ventoy from https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html
4. Install Ventoy in the empty USB drive and copy the "ubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso" file to the Ventoy drive.

5. The next step is to install the Ubuntu distro on your Windows 11 PC. To do this, you have to boot your PC from the bootable USB drive you created.
How to Install Ubuntu Linux Distro along with Windows

Step 1: Ensure the bootable drive is inserted into your Windows PC.

Step 2: Right-click on Start, hold SHIFT, and select Restart.

Step 3: Select “Use a Device”.

Step 4: On the next screen, you should see several devices you can boot from.

You may see the bootable drive as the name of the USB brand.

It’s possible to see it as “Ventoy” too. Some other times, you might not see it, so you need to click on “See more devices”.

If you still cannot see your bootable drive, head over to your boot menu by getting into BIOS. You will see it there.

Step 5: Now Ventoy boot screen will come. Select the Ubuntu iso. Boot normally. Choose “Install Ubuntu”. You can also try it before installing it.

Step 6:  Answer the setup prompts like keyboard, locale etc. to complete the Ubuntu installation.

6. Now You Can Dual Boot Ubuntu and Windows

Immediately after you reboot the computer, you should see a screen asking for the OS to bbot from.

Now, you can select which one to boot into between Ubuntu and Windows.

To boot into Ubuntu, select Ubuntu. And to boot into Windows, select Windows boot manager.
